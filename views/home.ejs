          <a href="https://thawing-anchorage-92010.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Newsletter Signup Page</a>
          <p>This is a working signup page, which allows you to enter your information which will be saved and kept by me. I will be able to send out email updates to everybody who signs up, all at the same time through the use of this app!</p>
          <p>Made using node.js and Mailchimp. Made with the help of Angela Yu's 2021 Web Development Boot Camp on Udemy.</p>

          <a href="https://young-journey-79689.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">A Persistent Online To-Do List</a>
          <p>My To-Do list is connected to a remote database, so that any items added or taken away will persist across multiple viewings. It also has the added functionality to make extra lists, simply by writing "/something" after the app's URL. Some examples include "https://young-journey-79689.herokuapp.com/work", or "https://young-journey-79689.herokuapp.com/groceries". Feel free to mess around with it and create your own list!</p>
          <p>Made using node.js and MongoDB. Made with the help of Angela Yu's 2021 Web Development Boot Camp on Udemy.</p>

          <a href="https://calm-reef-38370.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">A Restaurant Page</a>
          <p>This restaurant page uses PHP to build functional and dynamic sections of the site. There is a working email signup page, although I decided not to put any actual email to get submitted to, since I already have a newsletter signup page on this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Made using PHP. Final Project in Brad Hussey's Intro to PHP course on Udemy.</p>
